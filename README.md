# UberProject
This is part of my project for 5th semester. 
I was studying Object Oriented programing at that time in java.
This project is a replica of the "Uber" app
It has a command line interface, and is cleanly divided into seperate modules.
A fully detailed class structure can be found in the same directory as this README file; a UML file, and its screenshots in png format.
It does not have a graphical interface, so it would not be possible for me to attach screenshots of its interface.
